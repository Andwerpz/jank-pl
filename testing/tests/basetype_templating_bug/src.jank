//originally when registering a basetype, I was just adding it to a list of recognized basetypes, but not
//actually declaring it as a type. Declaring it as a type was deferred to when I added all the structs and their
//constructors, destructors, and functions. 

//the issue with this is that between these two things, I performed template resolution, which requires actual
//type definitions for all basetypes. So it would not be able to recognize the type 'B**' as defined, as the basetype
//'B' isn't actually defined yet. 

//the fix is to also register basetypes as types when registering all the basetypes initially. 

struct A {
    vector<B*> foo;
}

struct B {
    i32 bar;
}

i32 main() {
    cout << "this should compile\n";
    return 0;
}
