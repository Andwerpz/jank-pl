This program's job is to take in an EBNF grammar and spit out a parser for that grammar
The parser that gets generated should be whitespace agnostic, so should replace all substrings of whitespaces with just 1 space. 

The input EBNF should be all space separated. This is so I can use the whitespace to tokenize it. 

I should probably formally define the EBNF grammar that this is able to parse.
