**jank** is a lightweight, experimental programming language and compiler built from scratch in C++. **jank** combines C‑style syntax with a custom backend that directly emits x86‑64 assembly (AT&T syntax). 

In addition to the language and compiler, the project aims to include a fully custom assembler, allowing complete control over the compilation toolchain - from source code to raw machine code.

Features include:

- Recursive-descent parser
- AST-based semantic analysis
- Structs, functions, operator overloads
- Templating as macros
- Manual memory layout and stack management
- SSE-based float operations
- Basic import system and global variables
