# Jank Programming Language

## Description
I love Dylan Jank

## Abstract
Write a programming language. ðŸ¤¯

## Goal
Andrew Li says: Learn how programming languages work under the hood, the programming language we create doesn't have to be very useful or good, it can be a clone of C. I just want to know how to make one.

### Restrictions
- No writing an interpreted language. More specifically, we must write our own compiler, and in the end produce executable machine code

### Overview
 - Lexical Analysis
   - Recognizing keywords, operators, constants, etc.
 - Parsing
   - Understanding the stream of tokens, putting them into some sort of structure (like a parse tree)
 - Semantic Analysis
   - Understanding the meaning of the parse tree. This is so that we can check for type consistency and other stuff like that.
 - Optimization
   - Implementing transparent optimizations to the code. For this project, this phase can be ignored. 
 - Machine Code Generation
   - Generating bytecode from our chosen instruction set. 

### Short Term Tasks:
 - figure out how to rigorously define a grammar. 
 - decide on the 'theme' for the language. Is it going to be a clone of C, or a performance improvement to Python? 
   - Maybe we do Java, but add operator overloading
 - pick a target OS and instruction set for the language (can one OS run on different processors with different instruction sets? Perhaps should revisit this later with more knowledge)
 - define a grammar for the language.  
 - (Important!!) decide on a name for the language
   - If we do the Java improvement, maybe Jank is a good name? (holy moly dylan janky??)

## Logs

Ok, we're going to make a C clone targeted towards x86 Linux. I'm thinking that I just use EBNF to define my grammar. 

Hmm, seems like writing an EBNF parser is a project in of itself. I'll have to create a parser generator for EBNF, and then use the output to parse my stuff.

app.jank -> app.asm -> app.o
ASM syntax will be in [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax)

Assembler will convert ASM to [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)

`gcc -nostartfiles -no-pie -o bello.out bello.s`

### 5/9/2025
Seems like making a greedy EBNF parser is the easiest way to go. This means that my grammar will be restricted to being unambiguous, but that is perfectly fine. 

### 5/10/2025
Assembly components that I need to parse:
- Directives
  - begin with the `.`
- Labels
  - end with the `:`
- Instructions (Mnemonics)
  - opcodes
- Operands
  - operands to instructions
    - Registers: %rax, %rdi, %rsp
    - Immediates: $1, $0xFF
    - Symbols: msg, len
    - Memory: (%rax), 4(%rsp), etc.
- Expressions
  - can appear in data declarations or label math:
    - len = . - msg
- Comments
- String / Data
  - ascii stuff

### 5/12/2025
Seems like writing all the EBNF in one file will be very annoying. TODO, implement some sort of equivalent to #include but for my .ebnf files. The workflow will be like this: Parse .ebnf file with #include. Get all files referenced by #include. Parse those files. Once we build the full dependency graph, just insert the rest of the files in an arbitrary order into the final file, and insert the original file last (all without #includes). Finally, parse the resulting file. Circular dependencies are fine. 

Note that any ebnf parser generated will not automatically resolve #includes, that part is reserved for semantic analysis. It will just check if the syntax is correct. 

Also, will add `<` `>` as a new grouping tool to signify one or more. 

We'll stray from the C and C++ convention of having to declare stuff before using it. It'll be more like Java, as long as its declared somewhere, you're able to use it. 

### 5/13/2025
Added `to_string()` feature to all parser structs. This will probably be the last feature addition to the parser in a while.
